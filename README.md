Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a seasoned software developer with a strong background in full-stack development, specializing in Java, React, SQL, and Node.js. With over 16 years of experience in the aviation and logistics sectors, particularly in managing airline cargo systems, I bring a deep understanding of complex operational environments to the table.

In addition to my professional experience, Iâ€™ve worked on various freelance projects involving Angular and Node.js, and Iâ€™ve completed several online programming courses, with a notable focus on Python.

I completed a Frontend Development course at IPP and undertook an internship at Capgemini Engineering Talent Factory.

My passion for games and logic is evident in my work approach. I pride myself on my excellent problem-solving skills, sense of humor, and creativity, which I believe make me a valuable addition to any team.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch!
